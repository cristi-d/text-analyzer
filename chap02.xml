The other was to be sent at once to Bald Mountain and immediately start forming the cordon.

The first two, who had ventured to incite the people to rebel against Caesar, had been taken in armed struggle by the Roman authorities, were accounted to the procurator, and, consequently, would not be talked about here. But the second two, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri, had been seized by the local authorities and condemned by the Sanhedrin. According to the law, according to custom, one of these two criminals had to be released in honour of the great feast of Passover, which would begin that day. And so the procurator wished to know which of the two criminals the Sanhedrin intended to set free: Bar-Rabban or Ha-Nozri?</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="32792" endOffset="32875" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Kaifa inclined his head to signify that the question was clear to him, and replied:</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="32876" endOffset="33088" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"The Sanhedrin asks that Bar-Rabban be released."

If the latter, obviously an insane person, is guilty of uttering preposterous things in Yershalaim and some other places, the former's burden of guilt is more considerable. Not only did he allow himself to call directly for rebellion, but he also killed a guard during the attempt to arrest him. Bar-Rabban is incomparably more dangerous than Ha-Nozri.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="34097" endOffset="34300" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>On the strength of all the foregoing, the procurator asks the high priest to reconsider the decision and release the less harmful of the two condemned men, and that is without doubt Ha-Nozri.

Ha-Nozri was departing for ever, and there was no one to cure the dreadful, wicked pains of the procurator, there was no remedy for them except death. But it was not this thought which now struck Pilate. The same incomprehensible anguish that had already visited him on the balcony pierced his whole being. He tried at once to explain it, and the explanation was a strange one: it seemed vaguely to the procurator that there was something he had not finished saying to the condemned man, and perhaps something he had not finished hearing.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="35298" endOffset="35739" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Pilate drove this thought away, and it flew off as instantly as it had come flying. It flew off, and the anguish remained unexplained, for it could not well be explained by another brief thought that flashed like lightning and at once went out - "Immortality... immortality has come..."

In place of it all there floated some purple mass, water weeds swayed in it and began moving off somewhere, and Pilate himself began moving with them.

Having received the reply that it was Bar-Rabban, the procurator said:</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="43149" endOffset="43331" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"Very well," and told the secretary to put it into the record at once, clutched in his hand the clasp that the secretary had picked up from the sand, and said solemnly: It is time!"</originalText><parsedText>Very well,</parsedText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="43332" endOffset="43643" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Here all those present started down the wide marble stairway between walls of roses that exuded a stupefying aroma, descending lower and lower towards the palace wall, to the gates opening on to the big, smoothly paved square, at the end of which could be seen the columns and statues of the Yershalaim stadium.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="43644" endOffset="43839" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>As soon as the group entered the square from the garden and mounted the spacious stone platform that dominated the square, Pilate, looking around through narrowed eyelids, assessed the situation.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="43840" endOffset="44254" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>The space he had just traversed, that is, the space from the palace wall to the platform, was empty, but before him Pilate could no longer see the square - it had been swallowed up by the crowd, which would have poured over the platform and the cleared space as well, had it not been kept at bay by a triple row of Sebastean soldiers to the left of Pilate and soldiers of the auxiliary Iturean cohort to his right.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="44255" endOffset="44591" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>And so, Pilate mounted the platform, mechanically clutching the useless clasp in his fist and squinting his eyes. The procurator was squinting not because the sun burned his eyes - no! For some reason he did not want to see the group of condemned men who, as he knew perfectly well, were now being brought on to the platform behind him.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="44592" endOffset="45398" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>As soon as the white cloak with crimson lining appeared high up on the stone cliff over the verge of the human sea, the unseeing Pilate was struck in the ears by a wave of sound: "Ha-a-a..." It started mutedly, arising somewhere far away by the hippodrome, then became thunderous and, having held out for a few seconds, began to subside. They've seen me," the procurator thought. The wave had not reached its lowest point before it started swelling again unexpectedly and, swaying, rose higher than the first, and as foam boils up on the billows of the sea, so a whistling boiled up on this second wave and, separate, distinguishable from the thunder, the wails of women. They've been led on to the platform," thought Pilate, "and the wails mean that several women got crushed as the crowd surged forward."</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45399" endOffset="45542" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>He waited for some time, knowing that no power could silence the crowd before it exhaled all that was pent up in it and fell silent of itself.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45543" endOffset="45658" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>And when this moment came, the procurator threw up his right arm, and the last noise was blown away from the crowd.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45659" endOffset="45794" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Then Pilate drew into his breast as much of the hot air as he could and shouted, and his cracked voice carried over thousands of heads:</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45795" endOffset="45835" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"In the name of the emperor Caesar! ..."</originalText><parsedText>In the name of the emperor Caesar! ...</parsedText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45836" endOffset="45989" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Here his ears were struck several times by a clipped iron shout: the cohorts of soldiers raised high their spears and standards and shouted out terribly:</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="45990" endOffset="46009" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"Long live Caesar!"</originalText><parsedText>Long live Caesar!</parsedText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="46010" endOffset="46193" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Pilate lifted his face and thrust it straight into the sun.

Not a sigh, not a rustle reached his ears now, and there was even a moment when it seemed to Pilate that everything around him had vanished altogether. The hated city died, and he alone is standing there, scorched by the sheer rays, his face set against the sky. Pilate held the silence a little longer, and then began to cry out:</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="47487" endOffset="47882" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"The name of the one who will now be set free before you is..." He made one more pause, holding back the name, making sure he had said all, because he knew that the dead city would resurrect once the name of the lucky man was spoken, and no further words would be heard. "All?" Pilate whispered soundlessly to himself. "All. The name!" And, rolling the letter "r" over the silent city, he cried:</originalText><parsedText>The name of the one who will now be set free before you is... All? All.

He knew that behind his back the platform was being showered with bronze coins, dates, that people in the howling mob were climbing on shoulders, crushing each other, to see the miracle with their own eyes - how a man already in the grip of death escaped that grip! How the legionaries take the ropes off him, involuntarily causing him burning pain in his arms, dislocated during his interrogation; how he, wincing and groaning, nevertheless smiles a senseless, crazed smile.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="48700" endOffset="49044" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>He knew that at the same time the convoy was already leading the three men with bound arms to the side stairs, so as to take them to the road going west from the city, towards Bald Mountain.

Besides that, there came to his ears the tapping, clattering and approaching thud of hoofs, and a trumpet calling out something brief and merry. These sounds were answered by the drilling whistles of boys on the roofs of houses along the street that led from the bazaar to the hippodrome square, and by cries of "Look out!"</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="49583" endOffset="49781" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>A soldier, standing alone in the cleared space of the square with a standard in his hand, waved it anxiously, and then the procurator, the legate of the legion, the secretary and the convoy stopped.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="49782" endOffset="50025" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>A cavalry ala, at an ever-lengthening trot, flew out into the square, so as to cross it at one side, bypassing the mass of people, and ride down a lane under a stone wall covered with creeping vines, taking the shortest route to Bald Mountain.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="50026" endOffset="50667" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>At a flying trot, small as a boy, dark as a mulatto, the commander of the ala, a Syrian, coming abreast of Pilate, shouted something in a high voice and snatched his sword from its sheath.

Thrusting his sword back into its sheath, the commander struck the horse's neck with his crop, brought him down, and rode off into the lane, breaking into a gallop. After him, three by three, horsemen flew in a cloud of dust, the tips of their light bamboo lances bobbing, and faces dashed past the procurator - looking especially swarthy under their white turbans - with merrily bared, gleaming teeth.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="50668" endOffset="50822" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Raising dust to the sky, the ala burst into the lane,
