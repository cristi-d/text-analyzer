One of them, approximately forty years old, dressed in a grey summer suit, was short, dark-haired, plump, bald, and carried his respectable fedora hat in his hand. His neatly shaven face was adorned with black horn-rimmed glasses of a supernatural size. The other, a broad-shouldered young man with tousled reddish hair, his checkered cap cocked back on his head, was wearing a cowboy shirt, wrinkled white trousers and black sneakers.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="521" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="824" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>The first was none other than Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz, editor of a fat literary journal and chairman of the board of one of the major Moscow literary associations, called Massolit for short, and his young companion was the poet Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyrev, who wrote under the pseudonym of Homeless.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="825" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="1412" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Once in the shade of the barely greening lindens, the writers dashed first thing to a brightly painted stand with the sign: "Beer and Soft Drinks." Ah, yes, note must be made of the first oddity of this dreadful May evening. There was not a single person to be seen, not only by the stand, but also along the whole walk parallel to Malaya Bronnaya Street. At that hour when it seemed no longer possible to breathe, when the sun, having scorched Moscow, was collapsing in a dry haze somewhere beyond Sadovoye Ring, no one came under the lindens, no one sat on a bench, the walk was empty.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="1413" emmiter="Berlioz" endOffset="1446" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"Give us seltzer," Berlioz asked.</originalText><parsedText>Give us seltzer,</parsedText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="1447" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="1535" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"There is no seltzer," the woman in the stand said, and for some reason became offended.</originalText><parsedText>There is no seltzer,</parsedText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="1536" emmiter="Ivan" endOffset="1590" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"Is there beer?"

Ivan Nikolaevich had written this poem, and in a very short time, but unfortunately the editor was not at all satisfied with it. Homeless had portrayed the main character of his poem - that is, Jesus - in very dark colours, but nevertheless the whole poem, in the editor's opinion, had to be written over again. And so the editor was now giving the poet something of a lecture on Jesus, with the aim of underscoring the poet's essential error.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="4606" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="4906" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>It is hard to say what precisely had let Ivan Nikolaevich down - the descriptive powers of his talent or a total unfamiliarity with the question he was writing about - but his Jesus came out, well, completely alive, the once-existing Jesus, though, true, a Jesus furnished with all negative features.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="4907" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="5155" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Now, Berlioz wanted to prove to the poet that the main thing was not how Jesus was, good or bad, but that this same Jesus, as a person, simply never existed in the world, and all the stories about him were mere fiction, the most ordinary mythology.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="5156" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="5712" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>It must be noted that the editor was a well-read man and in his conversation very skillfully pointed to ancient historians - for instance, the famous Philo of Alexandria and the brilliantly educated Flavius Josephus  - who never said a word about the existence of Jesus. Displaying a solid erudition, Mikhail Alexandrovich also informed the poet, among other things, that the passage in the fifteenth book of Tacitus's famous Annals, the forty-fourth chapter, where mention is made of the execution of Jesus, was nothing but a later spurious interpolation.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="5713" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="5943" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>The poet, for whom everything the editor was telling him was new, listened attentively to Mikhail Alexandrovich, fixing his pert green eyes on him, and merely hiccupped from time to time, cursing the apricot soda under his breath.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="5944" emmiter="Berlioz" endOffset="6252" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"There's not a single Eastern religion," Berlioz was saying, "in which, as a rule, an immaculate virgin did not give birth to a god.

And just at the moment when Mikhail Alexandrovich was telling the poet how the Aztecs used to fashion figurines of Vitzli-putzli out of dough - the first man appeared in the walk.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="6917" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="7419" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Afterwards, when, frankly speaking, it was already too late, various institutions presented reports describing this man. A comparison of them cannot but cause amazement. Thus, the first of them said that the man was short, had gold teeth, and limped on his right leg. The second, that the man was enormously tall, had platinum crowns, and limped on his left leg. The third laconically averred that the man had no distinguishing marks. It must be acknowledged that none of these reports is of any value.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="7420" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="8023" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>First of all, the man described did not limp on any leg, and was neither short nor enormous, but simply tall. As for his teeth, he had platinum crowns on the left side and gold on the right. He was wearing an expensive grey suit and imported shoes of a matching colour. His grey beret was cocked rakishly over one ear; under his arm he carried a stick with a black knob shaped like a poodle's head. He looked to be a little over forty. Mouth somehow twisted. Clean-shaven. Dark-haired. Right eye black, left - for some reason - green. Dark eyebrows, but one higher than the other. In short, a foreigner.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="8024" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="8220" type="NARRATIVE"><originalText>Having passed by the bench on which the editor and the poet were placed, the foreigner gave them a sidelong look, stopped, and suddenly sat down on the next bench, two steps away from the friends.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="8221" emmiter="Narrator" endOffset="8288" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"A German..." thought Berlioz.

He rested his glance on the upper floors, where the glass dazzlingly reflected the broken-up sun which was for ever departing from Mikhail Alexandrovich, then shifted it lower down to where the windows were beginning to darken before evening, smiled condescendingly at something, narrowed his eves, put his hands on the knob and his chin on his hands.</originalText></utterance><utterance beginOffset="8862" emmiter="Berlioz" endOffset="9432" type="DIALOGUE"><originalText>"For instance, Ivan," Berlioz was saying, "you portrayed the birth of Jesus, the son of God, very well and satirically, but the gist of it is that a whole series of sons of God were born before Jesus, like, say, the Phoenician Adonis, the Phrygian Atris, the Persian Mithras. And, to put it briefly, not one of them was born or ever existed, Jesus included, and what's necessary is that, instead of portraying his birth or, suppose, the coming of the Magi, you portray the absurd rumours of their coming.
