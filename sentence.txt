Berlioz
's
high
tenor
rang
out
in
the
deserted
walk
,
and
as
Mikhail
Alexandrovich
went
deeper
into
the
maze
,
which
only
a
highly
educated
man
can
go
into
without
risking
a
broken
neck
,
the
poet
learned
more
and
more
interesting
and
useful
things
about
the
Egyptian
Osiris
,
a
benevolent
god
and
the
son
of
Heaven
and
Earth
,
and
about
the
Phoenician
god
Tammoz
,
and
about
Marduk
,
and
even
about
a
lesser
known
,
terrible
god
,
Vitzliputzli
,
once
greatly
venerated
by
the
Aztecs
in
Mexico
.
And
just
at
the
moment
when
Mikhail
Alexandrovich
was
telling
the
poet
how
the
Aztecs
used
to
fashion
figurines
of
Vitzli-putzli
out
of
dough
-
the
first
man
appeared
in
the
walk
.
